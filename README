1 Setup 
~~~~~~~~
  Boto library for accessing Amazon Web Services is required.

  1. Add `django_sqs' to your Python path
  2. Add `django_sqs' to INSTALLED_APPS setting
  3. Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  4. If DEBUG, set SQS_QUEUE_PREFIX to prefix your queues and avoid
     clashes with other developers, production/staging env and so on
  5. Optionally set SQS_DEFAULT_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT (default is 60 seconds)
  6. Optionally set SQS_POLL_PERIOD (default is 10 seconds)

2 Receivers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Create receiver function that accepts one argument, which will be an
  instance of `boto.sqs.message.Message' or its custom subclass.
  Then, register it as queue receiver:

2.1 Register using a decorator 
===============================
   Decorate receiver function with:

   django_sqs.receiver(queue_name, [visibility_timeout=None, message_class=None])

   Decorated function will become an instance of
   `django_sqs.registered_queue.RegisteredQueue.ReceiverProxy' class.
   Instance is callable - you may call it with an instance of
   appropriate message class, or its constructor's keyword arguments,
   and the message will be added to the queue.  Instance provides also
   attributes `direct' with original decorated function, and
   `registered_queue' with appropriate
   `django_sqs.registered_queue.RegisteredQueue' instance.

2.2 Register manually 
======================
   Alternatively, you can avoid decoration, and register a receiver
   manually by calling:

   django_sqs.register(queue_name, [fn=None, visibility_timeout=None, message_class=None])

   If `fn' is None or not given, no handler is assigned: messages can
   be sent, but won't be received.

   Create function in modules that will be imported by default
   (recommendation: use `receivers.py' and import them in `models.py',
   autoimporting TBD).

2.3 Example receiver 
=====================
   @receiver("test")
   def receive_message(msg):
       print 'received:', msg.get_body()

3 Receiving 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  python manage.py runreceiver [queue_name [queue_name [...]]]

  If no `queue_name' parameters are given, receive from all configured
  queues.

  If more than one queue is registered, a new process is forked for
  each queue.

  For each message received on the queue, registered receiver function
  is called with the message instance as argument.  If receiver
  function returns successfully (i.e. without raising an exception),
  message is then deleted from queue.  If receiver message raises an
  exception, message is left in queue for further processing.

4 Sending 
~~~~~~~~~~

4.1 Using decorated function 
=============================
   You can simply call function decorated with `@receiver' decorator,
   providing a message instance or keyword arguments (like for `send'
   function described below).

4.2 Manually 
=============
   To send a message manually, use following function:

   django_sqs.send(queue_name, message=None, **kwargs)

   `message' should be an instance of `message_class' configured with
   `receiver' decorator or `register' function for the queue (or
   `boto.sqs.message.Message').

   When `message' is omitted or `None', new instance of queue's message
   class will be instantiated using `**kwargs'.  With default message
   class, `boto.sqs.message.Message', we can simply provide body:

   django_sqs.send("a_queue", body='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet')

5 Custom message classes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For sending other values than raw, non-unicode strings, any of
  classes provided in `boto.sqs.message' or their subclasses may be
  used.  The module is well commented (much better than this one), so
  go ahead and read the fine source!

5.1 ModelInstanceMessage class 
===============================
   The `django_sqs.message.ModelInstanceMessage' class is provided for
   convenience.  It encodes a single model instance, using Django's
   ContentType framework (as app/model/primary key triple).  It
   accepts `instance' keyword parameter in constructor, and provides
   `get_instance()' method.

   There is no support for passing additional information except the
   instance yet.

6 FIXME 
~~~~~~~~

6.1 TODO Honor SQS_QUEUE_PREFIX even when not DEBUG 
====================================================

6.2 TODO Sensible forking/threading or multiplexing instead of the fork hack? 
==============================================================================

6.3 TODO Autoimporting receivers.py from apps 
==============================================

6.4 TODO docstrings 
====================

6.5 TODO Minimize polling 
==========================
   Amazon charges for every call.  Less polling, lower invoice.  Some
   exponential backoff + out-of-band signal (view?) to wake up a running
   receiver process may be a good thing.

6.6 TODO Custom exception to leave message in queue 
====================================================
   Provide a custom exception class that won't be handled by receive
   loop (i.e. no backtrace) that can be used by receiver function to
   explicitly leave message in queue without printing backtrace and
   alarming everyone.
